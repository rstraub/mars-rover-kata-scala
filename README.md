# Mars Rover Kata Scala

[Mars rover code kata](https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata) solved using Scala.

## Goals

- be pragmatic, don't overdo the solution
- use the type system to your advantage
- make the "core" immutable
- use Scala language's strengths (pattern matching etc)
- separate concerns (parsing/moving/etc)

## Takeaways

- Bugs enter the application easily when using the same primitive type for things with different semantics
- Tests helped catch these bugs early
